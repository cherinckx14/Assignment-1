    <h1> Christian Herinckx - herincch@oregonstate.edu - Computer Science, Sophomore</h1>
    <h2> Question 1</h2>
    <p> For one of my classes in highschool I created a fractal project where I implemented a couple of fractals visualized on a webpage using javascript, html, and css</p>
    <h2> Question 2</h2>
    <p> I hope to improve my javascript skills as well as make my code a lot cleaner. In the past I have looked everything up and definitely used inefficient methods of creating the website that I wanted.</p>
    <h2> Question 3</h2>
    <p> I have signed up for the course Piazza forum.</p>
    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>A random fact about me is that I'm very tall! I am 6'6" and contrary to what many people might think, I don't play much basketball. I did do high jump in track so I did end up using my height in a productive way. I'm excited to improve my web development skills in this class!</p>
